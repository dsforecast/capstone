    "This final project explores the best locations for new sneaker and lifestyle stores throughout the streets of New York City. New York is a major metropolitan area with more than 8.4 million (Quick Facts, 2018) inhabitants. Its the largest city in the US with a long history of international immigration and style innovation for the whole world. As Jay-Z and Alicia Keys once put it, if you can make it here, you can make it everywhere. In 2017, the total global sneakers market was valued at approximately 62.5 billion U.S. dollars and was forecast to reach a value of 97.8 billion U.S. dollars by 2024. (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1017918/sneakers-market-value-forecast-worldwide/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the competion is very high, the project aims to answer the question where are good locations to open a new sneaker store and what kind of target audience and clients can be expected. We also will try to answer the question if the store should be a classical retail store or a resell aka commission based to store.\n"
